# Paste this whole file to your gradle.properties file. The filled in example values
# work with the example branch csv files in the assets folder. Please change all
# values based on your csv files and their formatting and delete this example file as
# well as all provided example csv assets. Note that single space values, like for
# DELIM, must be escaped with a \  (backslash) or enclosed in " " (double quotes) to be
# preserved. If you select SETTINGSPERFILE then all values that can have multiple values
# need to have the appropriate number of commas, even for empty values.
